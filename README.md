Exam-management-information-system
==================================
## Description
* This is an exam management information system that can be used by schools to record student grades by respective subject teachers via an online portal, the marks can then be graded and merit lists produced based on a grading system set by the admin.
* Not fans of education system in our schools, very likely we wont be supporting this project, you can fork/clone it, make changes and write tests, even sell it and make a dime while some kid learns to hacks it and makes a dollar too.

## Features
* A teacher can enter marks from any location and device through a web interface.
* Teachers have a unique username(in this case phone number) and a password that allow them to only enter records to their allocated subjects in respect classes they teach.
* Automated marks processing system and ranking based on Total Points/Grouped Points/Total marks.
* Administator(s) roles:
  * Add users(teachers), students, classes and forms.
  * Register subjects.
  * Assign subject marks entry roles to teachers of respective classes
  * Create and process exams results
  * Enter and edit all students marks entries.
  * Define a grading system.
* Data is stored safely in the cloud, an obvious advantage over offline computers which can lose data through viruses/damaged/theft etc.
* Mobile application, android is currently supported.

## Getting started

### Requirements
This project was created on a debian linux platform but should work on other unix based[not limited to] systems.
* Tested on Debian Linux
* Python3
* node 10.2.0 and npm 6.3.0
* angular cli 6.0.0

### Cloning the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/reivhax/Exam-management.git && cd Exam-management
```
### Setting up Angular
#### Install node packages
```bash
cd front-end
npm install
ng serve
```
#### Edit django-rest api endpoint
* Edit environment.ts(.prod.ts in production) `apiEndPoint` to your django-rest endpoint.
#### Build for production and deploying to heroku
* Build your app with `npm run build:prod`
* Instead of using heroku angular webpack which is likely to run out of memory when using the free tier, you can build app on your local then deploy the compiled version using node js express to serve the static files.
* The ng app should work regardless of the approach you chose.

### Setting up Django
#### Creating a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m virtualenv virtual
source virtual/bin/activate
```
#### Installing dependencies
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements
```

#### Prepare environmet variables
For this project you will need the following configurations plus email setup for email registration hmac verification.
```python
SECRET_KEY= #secret key 
DEBUG= #set to false in production
DB_NAME= #database name
DB_USER= #database user
DB_PASSWORD=#database password
DB_HOST= #127.0.0.1
MODE= # dev or prod , set to prod during production
ALLOWED_HOSTS= #localhost,.herokuapp.com,.127.0.0.1
JWT_EXPIRATION_DAYS=7
CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST= #add angular app url here
```
#### Database migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
#### Running the server 
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
#### Deploying to heroku
Refer to this guide: [deploying django to heroku](https://github.com/jakhax/deploying-django-to-heroku-manual.git)

#### Running the tests
```bash
python manage.py test
```
Still in the process of writing more tests and havent commited them yet.

## Cordova build android
* Assuming you have android sdk(preferably through android studio), java and gradle installed.
* Install cordova with npm `npm install -g cordova`
* Create a cordova project `cordova create mobile`
* At this point you can copy contents of the `dist` folder created when you build the angular app and replace them with the contents of the `www` folder in the cordova project folder, you can also uses a system link.
* Add or edit the `<base href>` tag in `index.html` to `<base href="./">` since we will using a file path and not a url
* Add android , `cordova platform add android`
* Connect your android device via usb, enable usb-debugging then run `cordova run android`, it should run the app in your device.

## Lets Encrypt
To add SSL certificates to your heroku app follow this [guide](https://medium.com/@joshua.massover/lets-encrypt-ssl-using-django-on-heroku-c35edaaaeaac), sadly you are to have a hobby account(7$/m)
 on the bright side the certificates are free and generated by [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) as part fo the [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) movement.

## Technology used
* [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/)
* [Django 2.](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [Angular Cli](https://angular.io/)
* [cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)
* [Heroku](https://heroku.com)

## Known bugs
* No known bugs yet but this project is not even a week old so they has to a bunch of them.

## Contributing
- clone/fork, make changes and write tests.
- Open to suggestions on optimization methods.
